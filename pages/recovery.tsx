            The <strong>Red Pill</strong> offers greater rewards and exclusive access to the new Charisma token, positioning you for long-term growth while supporting Charisma's recovery.
            On the other hand, the <strong>Blue Pill</strong> provides priority on redemptions if you prefer a simpler recovery path.
            Both plans fully restore your lost tokens, but the Red Pill offers more value and control over your recovery, while the Blue Pill provides higher priority restitution.

        `The Red Pill option allows users to support Charisma's long-term recovery and receive 150% of their lost tokens' USD value in CHA tokens. Red Pill holders will also have exclusive access to wrap into the new Charisma token, giving their existing CHA tokens trade value.

        'The Blue Pill option is for users seeking immediate restitution. It provides the exact amount of tokens lost in the attack. Blue Pill holders will not have access to the new Charisma token, giving their existing CHA tokens no trade value until liquidity is restored for the STX-sCHA and STX-wCHA Velar pools. The more users choose the Blue Pill, the longer it will take for Charisma to recover.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does the vesting schedule work?',
      answer:
        'The vesting schedule for the Red Pill option follows a block-based release model. Initially, tokens can be wrapped into the new Charisma token every 10 blocks, but after the Nakamoto upgrade, blocks-per-tx will be adjusted to 100, meaning you can wrap tokens every 8-17 minutes depending on block times. Like iQC, it is first-come first-serve, so the earlier you wrap your tokens, the earlier you can swap them for other tokens. If CHA price has stabilized, the community can vote to reduce blocks-per-tx to speed up the release of tokens.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the new Charisma token?',
      answer:
        'The new Charisma token will be exclusively available to Red Pill holders and is designed to restore liquidity while preventing large sell-offs. It will be immediately listed on a DEX and funded with liquidity to ensure all Red Pill holders have access to trading liquidity for their Charisma tokens. It will follow a vesting schedule and iQC-like liquidity controls to ensure fair access and market stability. This will serve as the single primary trading token for Charisma moving forward.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How is the recovery timeline structured?',
      answer:
        'Tokens will be dispensed immediately after the burn and normalization. Red Pill holders will follow the vesting schedule, with liquidity flowing gradually into the market over the next few months. Blue Pill holders will have immediate access to their WELSH and ROO tokens, but lose the ability to swap their CHA tokens until there is more STX liquidity available to supply to STX-sCHA or STX-wCHA LPs.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Are there min and max values for blocks-per-tx and max-liquidity-flow?',
      answer:
        'Yes, there are min and max values for both blocks-per-tx and max-liquidity-flow. The min value for blocks-per-tx is 1 block, and the max is 1,000,000 blocks. For max-liquidity-flow, the min value is 1 token, and the max is 10,000 tokens. These parameters ensure controlled liquidity flow and prevent scenarios where a large amount of CHA tokens and dumped on the market. By enforcing these liquidity controls, the system prevents sudden sell-offs and market instability. This doubles as a security measure to protect the ecosystem from future attacks.',
